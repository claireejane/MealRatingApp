# 🍲 MealRatingApp

My first Python project ever — a handy little gadget to help me and my boyfriend decide what to cook for dinner based on prep time or rating. Meals are saved to a JSON file so they persist between runs.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new meals with:
  - Name
  - Rating (1–10)
  - Prep time (in minutes)
- Edit existing meals (update rating or prep time)
- Sort meals by:
  - Rating (highest → lowest)
  - Prep time (shortest → longest)
  - Name (A → Z)
- Persistent storage in `meals.json`

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (tested on Windows, should work everywhere)
- No extra libraries needed — just built-in `json`

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/MealRatingApp.git
cd MealRatingApp
python MealRatingApp.py
